# DevSpaces Workshop

To create the workshop assets run 'gulp'. This will generate a local instance of the web pages and it will also create a set of assets in the location dev-spaces-workshop/<version>. This is the location to point a httpd server at on OpenShift to serve the pages.

To update the version number edit the file documentation/antora.yml
