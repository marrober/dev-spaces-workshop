= Operator management

The operators required to operate DevSpaces were introduced in the previous section. In this section
information is presented on how to manage and configure DevSpaces for a specific requirement. A number of 
configuration parameters exist which are detailed below.

[NOTE]
====
Since you are sharing the OpenShift cluster with other users, it is not possible for you all to make the 
described changes to the cluster. This section is therefore an exercise in viewing the parameters and options.
To make a change you would simply change a value and hit save in the screens that you will see below, so 
there is little missing from the workshop.
